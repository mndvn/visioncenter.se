## Vision Center Project

This project has been created by Ã–mer Mindivanli (http://omermindivanli.com) for Vision Center. Vision Center has been founded by Dervis Aksay to prevent drug, crime and harmful addictions among teenagers in Sweden. Vision Center has a lot of different projects about creating awareness of bad choices between 14 and 23 aged youngers. (http://visioncenter.se)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Technologies

This project is fully open source and everybody can have a look the code structure of it. I aimed to create a good-looking web app with React, Bootstrap 4, React-Bootstrap, Eslint, Prettier, SASS, HTML, CSS and Redux.
